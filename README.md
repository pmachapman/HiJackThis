# HiJackThis

## Overview

HijackThis is a free utility that generates an in depth report of registry and file settings from your computer.

HijackThis scan results make no separation between safe and unsafe settings, which gives you the ability to selectively remove items from your machine.

In addition to scan and remove capabilities, HijackThis comes with several useful tools to manually remove malware from your computer.

However, HijackThis does not make value based calls between what is considered good or bad.

*It is important to exercise caution and avoid making changes to your computer settings, unless you have expert knowledge.*
